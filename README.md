# Fault-Detection-Using-Vibrational-Data
This repository features a fault detection project using vibrational data from IoT sensors on industrial machines. The goal is to identify faulty data indicating the need for maintenance. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is used to detect and flag noisy data points that signify potential faults.
